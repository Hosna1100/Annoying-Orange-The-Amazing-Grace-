colored text boxs, Reddit: u/GanstaKingofSA
as mentioned, Melody.chr created that pink notebook but I added some leaves in there instead of wood that makes it more look like a fruity poemgame.
I created all the sprites myself, even the poemgame chibis, except that the sprites of Apple and Orange are from cartooned version of 'Hey Apple!' that are edited by me (my mouse)
I just turned the Fnf mod 'Annoying Orange: The Amazing Grace' into a DDLC mod, the 'Rotten Smoothie' animation and song belongs to their respective owners.
I think you can go play that FNF mod by yourself but when I saw that Silly Billy, as they said. the lyrics look great but when I wnet to se it myself, it was so simple.
what's the matter with this FNF Reddit community? I mean, they were always talking about Sonic.exe several years ago and plenty of days ago, they always talking about Mario Madness
and now, they are always talking about Silly Billy, is this some sort of...anomally? what are they scheming for? or is it just prank? I cna't understands why they have special period of loving a mod and then, go or Travel to another.

"Sonic" "wait a second. I see something!"
"Tails" "Be careful, Sonic! it could be_"
"Sonic" "You worry too much, Tails. I'm sure it's just_"
*people in FNF community attack Sonic and he dies.*
