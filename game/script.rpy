    # This label configures the anticheat number for the game after Act 1.
    # It is recommended to leave this as-is and use the following in your script:

    #   X - The minimum number | Y - The maximum number
    $ anticheat = persistent.anticheat

    # This variable sets the chapter number to 0 to use in the mod.

    #   $ mi_name = "Mike". 
    # Don't forget to add the character to 'definitions.rpy'!
